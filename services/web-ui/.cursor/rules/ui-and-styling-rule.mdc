- Utilize Material UI `sx` prop to the extend possible for styling components.
- Ensure UI is responsive and accessible.
- Prioritize accessibility: use semantic HTML, proper ARIA attributes, and ensure sufficient color contrast in utility classes. Use tools like axe or Lighthouse for audits.
- Follow a consistent pattern for spacing, colors, and typography whenever possible, avoiding magic numbers.
