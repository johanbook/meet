- Each component must reside in its own folder named after the component, e.g., [ComponentName].
- Inside each component folder, the main component file must be named index.tsx.
- Each component folder must have a test file named [ComponentName].test.tsx.
- Components that are specific to pages or views and are not core should be placed inside the corresponding Views components folder.
- Core components (i.e., general-purpose components that can be used across views, such as inputs, accordions, etc.) should be placed under src/components/ui.
