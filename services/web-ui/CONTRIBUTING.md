# Contributing

The document outlines the development process of the **web-ui**
project.

## Setting up a local development environment

Start by cloning the Git repository.

### Installing dependencies and starting dev server

In order to run the development server, the Nodejs runtime together with the NPM
package manager are required. For Linux-based systems, these can be conveniently
handled using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Install all dependencies and Git hooks by running

```sh
npm i -D
```

Then, the development can be started by running

```sh
npm run start
```
