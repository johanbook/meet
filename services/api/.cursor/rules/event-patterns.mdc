# Event Patterns

- Domain events should have readonly public properties.
- Include relevant IDs: `entityId`, `organizationId`, `profileId`.
- Use descriptive event names: `{Entity}{Action}Event` (e.g., `BlogPostCommentReactionCreatedEvent`).
- Publish events after successful database operations, not before.
- Use `map()` from `src/core/mapper` to create event instances.
- Events should be immutable data structures.
- Include timestamp information for event ordering.
- Keep events focused on state changes, not process flows.
- Use event handlers for side effects like notifications.
- Ensure events contain all necessary data for handlers.
- Follow the past-tense naming convention for events (Created, Updated, Deleted).
