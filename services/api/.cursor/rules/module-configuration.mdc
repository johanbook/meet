# Module Configuration

- Add new entities to `TypeOrmModule.forFeature([...entities])` array.
- Add new controllers to the `controllers` array.
- Add new handlers to the `providers` array.
- Import required modules in the `imports` array.
- Order imports alphabetically within each category (core, application, infrastructure).
- Use `@Module()` decorator with proper configuration object.
- Export services that need to be used by other modules.
- Keep modules focused on a single business domain.
- Import only necessary dependencies to avoid circular dependencies.
- Use barrel exports (`index.ts`) for cleaner imports between modules.
