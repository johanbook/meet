# Entity & Database Patterns

- All entities must extend `BaseEntity` from `src/core/database`.
- Use `@Entity()` decorator for TypeORM entities.
- Use `@Unique()` decorator for composite unique constraints (e.g., `@Unique(["parentId", "profileId"])`).
- Establish proper relationships using `@ManyToOne`, `@OneToMany` decorators.
- Use `cascade: true` for OneToMany relationships when child entities should be auto-managed.
- Use `onDelete: "CASCADE"` for foreign key relationships when parent deletion should cascade.
- Column types should be explicitly defined (e.g., `{ type: "varchar", length: 8 }`).
- Import related entities in the correct order to avoid circular dependencies.
- Use meaningful entity names that reflect the business domain.
- Always include foreign key columns alongside relationship decorators.
