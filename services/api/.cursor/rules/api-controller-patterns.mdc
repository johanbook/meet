# API Controller Patterns

- Use `@Controller("path")` and `@ApiTags("tag")` decorators.
- Use `@Post()` for create operations, `@Delete()` for delete operations.
- Use `@Body()` for command data, `@Query()` for delete commands.
- Return `Promise<null>` for command operations.
- Use `CommandBus.execute(command)` to execute commands.
- Use `QueryBus.execute(query)` to execute queries.
- Apply proper HTTP method semantics (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Use meaningful endpoint paths that reflect the resource hierarchy.
- Implement proper input validation using DTOs and decorators.
- Keep controllers thin - delegate business logic to handlers.
- Use consistent response formats across all endpoints.
- Apply authorization guards as needed.
