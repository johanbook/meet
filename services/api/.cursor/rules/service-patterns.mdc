# Service Patterns

- Services should be decorated with `@Injectable()`.
- Use constructor injection for dependencies.
- Inject all required repositories in the service constructor.
- Follow the pattern: `async methodName(entity: Entity, parentEntity: ParentEntity): Promise<void>`.
- Use `map()` from `src/core/mapper` to create domain events.
- Always publish events after successful database operations.
- Keep services focused on domain logic, not presentation concerns.
- Use meaningful method names that describe the business operation.
- Handle cascading operations within service methods.
- Ensure transactional consistency across related entity operations.
