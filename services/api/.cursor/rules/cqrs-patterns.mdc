# CQRS & Command/Query Patterns

- Use `@CommandHandler(CommandClass)` decorator for command handlers.
- Use `@QueryHandler(QueryClass)` decorator for query handlers.
- Command handlers should implement `ICommandHandler<TCommand, TResult>`.
- Query handlers should implement `IQueryHandler<TQuery, TResult>`.
- Commands should use validation decorators (`@IsUUID()`, `@Length()`).
- Use `@InjectRepository(Entity)` to inject TypeORM repositories.
- Publish domain events using `EventBus` after successful operations.
- Commands should be immutable with readonly properties.
- Separate read and write operations clearly between queries and commands.
- Keep command handlers focused on a single responsibility.
