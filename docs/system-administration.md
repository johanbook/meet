# System administration

The system exposes an administration area (called "the console"). There are
various administration tools available from the console, allow operators to
inspect system routing, data storage and users.

## Guide

To access the console for an environment, navigate to `console.DOMAIN` where
`DOMAIN` is the URL where the environment is deployed. Note that credentials are
required to access the console which are configured during the initial system
setup.
